How to use the oython scripts in this folder
USE ONLY SQUARE IMAGES

BW_1bit
  what it does:
    creates a mif img with image_lengthximage_width indexable locations that each store 1 bit: : if pixel is black (0) or 
    white(1)
  use for images:
    -that have just 1 color
  STEPS
    1. change input filename to <image_name>.png
    2. change output filename to <image_name>.mif
    3. in lines 23-24 chanes the w & h variable to the width and height of your image
    4. run

BW_2bit
  what it does:
    creates a mif img with image_lengthximage_width indexable locations that each store 2 bits: bit[1] specifies a background     pixel (please use 0xc0c0c0 for background color); bit[0] specifies if pixel is black (0) or white(1)
  use for images:
    -that have 2 colors & a background
  STEPS
    1. change input filename to <image_name>.png
    2. change output filename to <image_name>.mif
    3. in lines 23-24 chanes the w & h variable to the width and height of your image
    4. run

BW_multifile
  what it does:
    creates a mif img with image_lengthximage_widthx#_of_files indexable locations that each store 1 bit: if pixel is black       (0) or white(1)
  use for:
    -concatenating multiple png images into a single mif file (think #s or letters)
  STEPS:
    1. change input_filename array to contain all the files you want analyzed
    2. LINE 19, change the f.write(str(...)) command to write in the full size of the mif file you want (lengthxwidthx#files, 
    so for 0-9#s, this was 30x30x10 = 900)
    3. change output_filename to <name>.mif
    4. run
